Hi, I'm Mario.

I've been a technical leader for over 20 years, playing around with things like C#, Golang, MySQL, ASP.NET Core, microservices and more. I'm comfortable on platforms like Linux, Windows, Mac. I'm also proficient with modern DevOps practices looking to ensure efficient and reliable software delivery.
