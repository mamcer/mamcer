Hi, I'm Mario

A software developer with more than 20 years of professional experience working with programming languages and technologies like C++, C# and Golang on Windows, Linux and Mac platforms

For more information and/or tech stories, you can see my [blog](https://mamcer.github.io/)

Also for legacy projects and source code from 2007 to 2018 you can review my [blog post](https://mamcer.github.io/2018-09-02-i-cleaned-up-my-virtual-basement/) (some of them are barely more than a POC but they all teach me something new)
