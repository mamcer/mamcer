Hi, I'm Mario Moreno

A software developer with more than 20 years of professional experience, most of them in the .NET stack but always working and tinkering with different technologies and platforms

In my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mamcer) you can find different repositories with my most elaborated 'experiments'. My first projects start with C++, Ruby then C# (a lot) and lately Golang

Lately I no longer program like before, at least nothing outside fast POCs that are not worth posting on GitHub

For more information you can see my [blog](https://mamcer.github.io/) and my profile on [LinkedIn](https://ar.linkedin.com/in/mamcer)
