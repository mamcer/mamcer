Hi, my name is Mario

I'm a technical leader with over 20 years of professional experience building software and people. I have experience with different technologies like C#, Golang, MySQL, architecting solutions that range from on-premises monoliths to cloud-native microservices. I'm proficient across Linux, Windows, and Mac platforms and I am passionate about using modern DevOps practices to ensure efficient and reliable software delivery.

Eternal learner, this is the way.
