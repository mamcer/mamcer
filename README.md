Hi, I am Mario Moreno

A software developer with more than 20 years of professional experience working with programming languages and technologies like C++, Ruby, C# and Golang on Windows and Linux platforms. 

Lately I no longer code like before, but I still preserve that passion about technology and desire to learn. Which end up instantiating in fast POCs, scripts, local infrastructure configuration or little programs for a specific goal that mostly are not worth posting on GitHub. Beyond the opportunities and professional experience in my workplace

For more information and/or tech stories, you can see my [blog](https://mamcer.github.io/)

Also for legacy projects and source code from 2007 to 2018 you can review my [blog post](https://mamcer.github.io/2018-09-02-i-cleaned-up-my-virtual-basement/) (some of them are barely more than a POC but they all teach me something new)
