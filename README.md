I'm a technical leader with over 20 years of experience building software and people. I have experience with several technologies like C#, Golang, MySQL, architecting solutions that range from on-premises monoliths to cloud-native microservices. I'm proficient across Linux, Windows, and Mac platforms and I am passionate about using modern DevOps practices to ensure efficient and reliable software delivery.

There is always something new to learn.
