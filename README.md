Hi, I am Mario Moreno

A software developer with more than 20 years of professional experience, most of them in the .Net stack but always working and tinkering with different technologies and platforms

In my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mamcer) you can find different repositories with my most elaborated 'experiments'.  Using technologies (in order) like: C++, Ruby, C# (a lot) and Golang

Lately I no longer program like before, at least nothing outside fast POCs that mostly are not worth posting on GitHub

For more information and/or tech stories, you can see my [blog](https://mamcer.github.io/)
